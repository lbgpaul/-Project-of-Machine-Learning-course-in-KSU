# The-Combination-between-Two-DataSets-and-Two-Models
Project of Machine Learning course in KSU


I built a Convolution neural network (CNN) model based on existing models, which I picked up on the Kaggle website.

**Model:**
First, VGG16
[U. S. Michael Macht New York New York, “mask detection, visualization,” 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelcripman/maskdetection-visualization)

Second, MobileNet
[M. Matta, “real vs fake face,” 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/martin1234567890/real-vs-fake-face)

**Database:**
First, face masks dataset
[S. a. L. K. H. I. Ashish Jangra, “Face mask 12k images dataset,” 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/facemask-12k-images-dataset/metadata)

Second, Real and Fake human face dataset
[C. Intelligence and K. Photography Lab, Department of Computer Science Yonsei University, “Real and fake face detection,”2019](https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-facedetection/metadata)


I didn't build the CNN classifier from the scratch. but from other's and did some modification.

The models were originally built for two-class classifiers, and I hoped to build a three-class classifier.

After implement the original model, I found the result didn't match the result on the kaggle website.
