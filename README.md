# The-Combination-between-Two-DataSets-and-Two-Models
Project of Machine Learning course in KSU


I built a Convolution neural network (CNN) model based on existing models, which I picked up on the Kaggle website.

Model:

First, VGG16

Second, MobileNet

Database:

First, face masks dataset

Second, Real and Fake human face dataset
